Phase 0 Bootstrap Complete

Date: 2026-02-02
Project: trivial-todo-app
Repo: https://github.com/johnnyrootio/trivial-todo-app

Bootstrap artifacts created:
✅ Directory structure (specs/, contracts/, docs/plans/, src/, tests/, scripts/)
✅ pyproject.toml (Python 3.12+, typer, pytest, ruff, mypy)
✅ scripts/check.sh (quality gate: format, lint, typecheck, test)
✅ Source skeleton (cli.py, todo.py, storage.py with type hints)
✅ Test structure (unit/, integration/, blackbox/ with placeholder)
✅ README.md (Quick Start, architecture, development guide)
✅ .gitignore (Python standard + todos.json)
✅ Agent prompts (worker, supervisor, reviewer)

Tech Stack:
- Python 3.12+
- typer for CLI
- pytest for testing
- ruff for linting/formatting
- mypy for type checking
- Simple JSON file persistence

Quality Gate:
- Single source of truth: ./scripts/check.sh
- No CI (local execution only)
- Format, lint, typecheck, tests must pass

Next Phase:
Phase 1 - Specification (operational spec, contract spec, technical spec)
